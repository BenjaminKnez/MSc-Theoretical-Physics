# MSc project code
In this repo, developed code used in the work for my MSc thesis can be found.

**Living.py**: Simulates the relaxation mechanisms of euqilibrium living polymers with respect to breakage timescale rate

**Living_competition.py**: Simulates the competition between breakage and recombination when there is a dependence of recombination on ATP

**Break.py**: Simulates the relaxation of non-equilibrium living polymers undergoing only breakage

**Fuse.py**: Simulates the relaxation of non-equilibrium living polymers undergoing only recombination

**Fuse_ATP.py**: Simulates the relaxation of non-equilibrium living polymers undergoing only recombination, where there is a dependence on ATP

**Num_rem_end.py**: Simulation of the recombining free polymer ends in a box

**MD_analysis.c++**: Code for the analysis of the reaction rate in equilibrium polymers (molecular dynamics simulations)
